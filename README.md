## What is this project?

At first, this work served me to improve my front-end development skills.

Then, with my great potential sight, I took it for real and turn it into a portfolio masterpiece.

The results are shown here at [Github Pages](https://veigacoder.github.io/veiga-dashboard/)


## Steps to the goal 

>I started with the basics of a react-app, which consists of:

> - `npm i react-app`

> Cleanead up **_src_** and **_public_** folders with unused files and file parts, like comments and tests setups.

> - `npm i react-router-dom`

> Set up a basic `<Router>` at **App** for navigation.
>> Then, at this part, I spent a whole day just to find out that the **index** of my app should have a `<BrowserRouter>` element for running.  
><p> Live and learn. 

> - `npm i styled-components`

> I liked to play with colors and containers creation.<p>I started with pitch black backgrounds and ended up with high saturated colors. Like I said, just playing around.

> After seeing this app pontetial for me, I thought I'd take it seriously. So, spent some hours learning how to deploy an app at `GitHub Pages`.

> - `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

>I really messed up here a few times, deploying my app on a wrong branch, deleting it from my PC. Things like that. <p>_First timer at this._</p>
After those long hours spent learning it right, the App was live at GitHub Pages.

 >Then I started framing out some icons, just to play a bit with `.svg` files. Another challenge. This extension smells like witchcraft. 
 >>**09/23/2021** : Right now, I still trying to learn it properly.
